<AbstractNarration>The team will conduct direct spectroscopic observations of large, nearby exoplanets with a high-resolution spectrometer. They will characterize the composition of the atmospheres of young “hot Jupiters” by direct observation. They will focus on abundances of common molecules such as carbon monoxide, methane and water. Their plan is to conduct the first-ever survey of the youngest massive exoplanets, still in the formation process. Their observations will constrain models of planet formation, helping to understand how solar systems form, including our own. This work will support a graduate student and will form the basis of that student’s PhD thesis at Rice University. The team will purchase and use a commercial spectrograph for nightly public outreach at Lowell Observatory. They will also develop educational experiences for high school students using the instrument as well as a graduate-level observation course.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this research is to characterize the atmospheres of exoplanets through direct spectroscopic observations. In order to do this, they need bright targets. For this reason, they will focus on planets called “hot Jupiters:” planets of Jovian mass or greater that closely (within 0.1 AU) orbit their parent stars. They will be gathering light directly from the planet, following the planet through its orbit, and observing in a variety of molecular lines. As a planet moves through its orbit, those lines will be doppler shifted. The planetary features are identified through their larger doppler shifts relative to the shifts of the parent star (because the planet moves a great deal more and is subject to a higher degree of shifting). The team will use the IGRINS instrument, which has been mated with a variety of large telescopes including the Lowell 4.3 meter and Gemini North. As a backup instrument, they will also use the iSHELL instrument on IRTF or other instruments as needed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
